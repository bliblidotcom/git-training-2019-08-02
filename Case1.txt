Case :
Bagaimana urutan branching dan merging jika ada fitur a, fitur c, dan bug b, yang harus di deploy ke production minggu depan, dan sekarang kita cuma punya branch master?

Answer:
- Create branch feature/a
- Create branch feature/c
- Create branch bug/b
- Working on that branch for features and bugs
- If bug b have done, Merge bug/b to release/abc
- If feature/a done, Merge feature/a to release/abc
- If feature/c done, Merge feature/c to release/abc
- Checking for merge conflict if that happened
- Merge release/abc into master

final branch list :
- master
- feature/a
- feature/c
- bug/b
